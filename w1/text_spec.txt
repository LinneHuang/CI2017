# Showing [trending spots] in [city]

## User Flow

1. The user asks [city]
2. The bot replies with [1 random trendy spot, from no.1 to no.5 on the list] in [city]


## Possible Engineering

1. The user provides a [cityName]
2. The bot sends [cityName] to call the data of [trending]
3. The bot selects one from the top 5 spots, randomly
4. The bot speaks out [chosenTrendingSpot]
